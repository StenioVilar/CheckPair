# Pair Sum Finder

## Description

This Java program finds a pair of numbers, one from each of two given integer arrays, whose sum equals a specified input value. The program implements two different approaches:

1. **HashMap Method (O(n + m))** – Used for unsorted arrays.
2. **Two Pointers Method (O(n))** – Optimized for sorted arrays.

## Features

- Efficient search for pairs using HashMap for unsorted arrays.
- Optimized Two Pointers approach for sorted arrays.
- Returns indices of the found pair or `-1, -1` if no pair exists.
